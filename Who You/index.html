			I am Janssen Ainsley R. Sison but you can call me "Jans" for short. I live in San Pedro, Laguna and I was born on May 7, 1996. My hobbies are playing online games, watching anime, and hanging out with my friends. I am a working student and I'm currently working as a copywriter, writing reviews of courses, coaches and businesses in other countries. We're a family of 4, and I'm the eldest of the two. I'm currently enrolled at Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa as a transferee student.

			At present, I'm preparing towards my dream of becoming a game developer in the near future. I want to make games that people will love, just like how I love playing the games that I'm still playing until today.
